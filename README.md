# Rethinking Object-Oriented Programming: Is It a Big Mistake?

In recent years, the software development community has seen a spirited debate around the merits—and pitfalls—of object-oriented programming (OOP). While OOP has powered countless applications and remains a cornerstone of many codebases, a growing number of developers question whether its inherent complexities outweigh its benefits.

## The problem with OOP

### The Inheritance Trap

One of the most common criticisms is the over-reliance on deep inheritance hierarchies. In theory, organizing code into a hierarchy of classes should promote reuse and clarity. In practice, however, these hierarchies can quickly become convoluted. When each subclass depends heavily on its parent, even small changes can ripple unpredictably throughout the system, making the code difficult to debug and maintain.

### Hidden Dependencies and Mutable State

OOP’s promise of encapsulation is intended to bundle data with behavior, safeguarding internal states from unintended interference. Yet this often leads to hidden dependencies where the true flow of data is obscured. Furthermore, mutable state—central to many OOP designs—can result in side effects that complicate testing and parallel processing. In environments where predictability and immutability are prized, such as in concurrent programming, these issues become particularly problematic.

### The Boilerplate and Over-Engineering Conundrum

Another point of contention is the amount of boilerplate code OOP frequently demands. Setting up classes, interfaces, and inheritance structures can introduce a significant overhead before you even write the logic that matters. Moreover, the flexibility of OOP sometimes seduces developers into over-engineering solutions. Rather than crafting a straightforward solution, it’s all too easy to build an intricate web of classes that obscure rather than illuminate the problem.

### Golang’s Procedural Style: A Breath of Fresh Air

Enter Golang. Known for its simplicity and efficiency, Golang often embraces a more procedural style rather than strictly adhering to OOP principles. This approach favors straightforward functions and minimal abstraction, reducing the overhead typically associated with deep class hierarchies. Golang's design encourages writing clear, concise code that is easier to maintain and reason about. By focusing on composable functions and explicit data handling, Golang helps developers avoid some of the pitfalls of hidden dependencies and mutable state, providing a compelling alternative in scenarios where simplicity and performance are paramount.

### FP

Critics of OOP often point to functional programming (FP) as another promising alternative. With FP’s emphasis on immutability and pure functions, developers can achieve more predictable and easier-to-reason-about code. Even within the realm of OOP, modern design principles now advocate for “composition over inheritance,” encouraging developers to assemble systems from smaller, more manageable components rather than relying on complex hierarchies.

### Conclusion

In my opinion Golang’s procedural style offers a refreshing counterpoint, emphasizing clarity and simplicity over the sometimes cumbersome abstractions of OOP. In my journey as a developer, I’ve come to appreciate that no single programming paradigm holds all the answers. Instead, embracing a **hybrid approach** that leverages the strengths of OOP, functional programming, and procedural styles like those found in Golang can lead to more robust, maintainable, and efficient software.
